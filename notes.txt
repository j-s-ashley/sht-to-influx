running discover.py yields this tasty tidbit:

```
E0:C6:BC:1A:E7:A9: Smart Humigadget
-----------------------------------
AdvertisementData(local_name='Smart Humigadget', rssi=-64)
```

So, maybe all the ones we want to use will have that same `local_name` variable?? Would be super cool.

Okie dokie. Cap'n Crunch levels of fo-cereal now.

In trying to see about that `local_name` variable idea, I ended up discovering that the **ONE** button on these little doohickies does not function properly for most sensors.

What it's supposed to do:
 - Quick press: cycle between showing the dew point or relative humidity on the top line
 - Long press (>1s): enable/disable bluetooth connectivity
 - Hold down while inserting battery: switch between Celsius and Fahreneheit

What it actually does:
 - Quick press: sometimes freeze whatever numbers are displayed, sometimes display a blank screen for a few seconds, sometimes do nothing
 - Long press (>1s): same as quick press results
 - Hold down while inserting battery: switch between Celsius and Fahreneheit

I did, however, confirm that the `local_name` variable is consistent.
